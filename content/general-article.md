After coming across some beautiful blogs created with [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), I have decided to look further into finally starting a blog. This is something that I've always been meaning to do but just never thought I have much to say.

I generally like to write, and I mostly write technical documents for work, KB articles, usage guides, troubleshooting guides, etc. So I guess this is one thing I can write about. Also I think a blog would be a good place just to collect knowledge, things that you never get around to do but rather keep them on the to-do-someday list.

Usually, I find myself experimenting with things, and those things sometimes lead to insights, I keep a mental note, but that always gets lost in the mundane day-to-day activities. So hopefully a blog would help me be more organized.

The one condition is that it has to be **easy**. Meaning that If I have to think twice about the hurdle of writing an article, I'm going to lose interest pretty quickly. So it has to be doable with minimal tinkering, it has to just work. A couple of commands should be all that is needed to publish something. Also it has to be something that I can do from anywhere. So far the work flow using Pelican + GitHub pages seems to be sufficient enough to publish either from my Work or Home laptop, since everything is tracked in Git. I'm not so sure about publishing from a Mobile device yet, but I'll look into it.

## What will I be writing about?

You can expect me to write about Linux, Ansible and Docker as my most day-to-day activities. I also work with Python, Django, Flask, and FastAPI fairly frequently.

## The Bare Minimum

A good spell checker is a must, the spell checker in VS Code is quite dump, I wonder if I could somehow use Grammerly - which is an excellent tool - without leaving the comfort of VS Code.

A blog needs to hit a fine balance of being readable and useful. Content is King of course and no matter how good the usability of it, it won't matter if the content is rubbish. But there are still things that every good blog should have, for example:

- A way to view similar posts
- A way to share a post
- A way to bookmark
- Next and Previous articles in a series is always nice
- A good search box (this is a maybe)
- An archive with years, months, etc
- A comments section (another maybe)

So far I'm just getting started with Pelican, but my understanding is that it has plugins for all those things, so next I'm going to experiment with that.

Pelican also has a huge collection of Themes, I especially liked `pelican-bootstrap3` with the variation `Flatly`, because it looked to me so AWS like, the font used is brilliant, and it's clean and clear.

Off to do some more exploring.
