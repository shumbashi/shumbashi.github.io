I'm Ahmed Shibani, a DevOps Engineer from Libya. After earning my Bachelor of Science degree in Electronics Engineering from University of Tripoli in 2006, I entered the information technology world to explore my passion for computers and technology.

I joined [Libyan Spider](https://libyanspider.com) in 2016 as Chief Technology Officer. Prior to Libyan Spider, I was Systems Specialist and Technical Manager at LibyaOnLine, and IT Coordinator at Chevron Libya Ltd, with some brief stunts in-between working as a consultant for various companies. I currently live in Tripoli, Libya with my wife and 3 kids.

Libyan Spider is a Web Hosting company with hundreds of servers and a huge infrastructure built to deliver web, email, and cloud services to tens of thousands of customers. My specialities there revolve around Linux, DevOps practices, Cloud Architecture, Monitoring, and Automation. In addition to people's and project management.

I am an avid reader, I enjoy reading about history, science, fiction, productivity, and autobiographies. You can check my Goodreads profile [here](https://goodreads.com/shumbashi). You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ashibani) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashibani), and I maintain open source projects on [Github](https://github.com/shumbashi)
